In this respository you can find some of the numerical simulations I have been working on during my master's programme in Computaional Physics at Stockholm University.

The implementations range from: Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo and Variational Monte Carlo for different applications, Finite Differences implementation and Inverse Power Iteration for solving Eigenvalue problems, collocation method with B-splines as well as B-splines for solving Eigenvalue problems.  

All simulations come with their corresponding written reports.

This is just the beginning.

Much more to come.
